### [PowerShell & DevOps Global Conference 2020 - Online Edition](https://powershell.org/24hour/)

We see a lot talks on testing PowerShell with Pester, but are the tests we write good tests? What makes a test "good"? How do we measure how effective our tests are? This talk will help you answer these questions, including why testing is important and how to apply these principles to your project.
