### [PowerShell Summit North America 2018](https://powershell.org/summit/)

A side session at the PowerShell summit about Lean Coffee

---

"Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated."

Lean coffee style meetings are used in many meetups.  But it could be a useful tool for hackdays or just to try something different.

In this side session, we'll layout how a Lean Coffee meeting works and then get straight into a Lean Coffee meeting (BYO coffee)
