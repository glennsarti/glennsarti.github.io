Hi! I'm located in Perth (Western Australia) where I now work at [HashiCorp](https://hashicorp.com) as a Senior Engineer.
Previously I was at [Telstra Purple](https://purple.telstra.com.au/) as a Senior Consultant, and at [Puppet](http://puppet.com) as Senior Software Developer on the Windows team.
From December 2015 my family and I made the big move to Portland (Oregon, United States), but moved back to Perth in late 2017.

I have spent well over a decade as a Windows Client and Infrastructure engineer, with a heavy focus on automation and infrastructure software development. I was also a co-organiser for the Perth DevOps meetup and Portland PowerShell User Group, and have spoken at many meetups and conferences.

I'm also a contributor to [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com), helping out with management of Neo4j on Windows.

... and I'm a contributor to the Puppet VS Code Extension ([Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpogran.puppet-vscode))
